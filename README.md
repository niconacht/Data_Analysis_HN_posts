# Data_Analysis_HN_posts

n this analysis, I am going to analyze a sample of an HN data set of post listings. 
Among others, popular post categories are "Show HN", in which users show the audience their projects or concepts. 
The other popular category I am going to examine is "Ask HN", where users post their questions to the community hoping to get an appropriate answer. The aim of this analysis is to find out, which of the two categories creates most user comments, 
and whether the timing of the post is relevant for the quantity of comments.
